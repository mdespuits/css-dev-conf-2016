# Reponsive Web Apps with Container Queries

#### Goals

1. **Evolve the Design**. Iterate on it. Come up with new ideas and apply those ideas throughout the site.
2. **Support Multiple Devices**

Everything was generally a device-specific design and development process.

Designers see a feature through for all of the different platforms.

## Designers should think Responsive before they need to.

This will make the responsive move **when it comes around, because it will**, much faster when the responsive part has already been proven.

## Container Queries enable faster development

Since the "media" queries were based on the container rather than the entire page, it makes the CSS and styling you write much smaller and much more understandable (fewer edge-cases).
